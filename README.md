The Mac Powermetrics output reader and GPU monitor no one was looking for 

Overall a pretty simple app i made out of boredom. reads you mac outputs in your system, wich it reads (mainly the gpu wich is on primary display) with the rest of the things in a scroll menu at the bottom that you can just search through to find specific info.

basic stuff, love yall
